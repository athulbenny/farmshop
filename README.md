# FarmShop


A new Flutter project.

## Why FarmShop:
 - Build a direct link between farmers and customers
 - Avoiding intermediaries 
 -  Farmers can add their product with the expected price (farmers will be given full control over their products)
- Customer can select products as per their need and add to cart
- For increasing job opportunities through this app, we are planing to add product delivery facilities. These delivery peoples are considered as real supporters of this application
- Channels are provided for easy communication of farmers and customers
